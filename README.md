Curve fitting for Covid-19 Cases and Death

This script takes data downloaded from the WHO and fits a curve to the number of cases and the number of deaths in several countries. 

A polynomial of the 10th degree is chosen on the basis of test score and RMSE in the "choosing a beft fit" portion of the script using a training and testing dataset.


Then, the 10th degree polynomial is fit to all of the data and the results are plotted.
